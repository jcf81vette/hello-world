My first repository

I am married and a father of three.  I have been a Police Officer for the past 13 years. I am also currently attending Arizona State University online working on my electrical engineering degree so that I can change careers.  I will be eligible to retire from the police department at 15 years due to prior active duty military time, so once I complete my degree I will retire and start an EE career.
